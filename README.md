Probabilistic soft logic (PSL) is a probabilistic programming language for reasoning about
relational and structured data that is designed to be highly scalable. More information about PSL
is available at the [PSL homepage](http://psl.cs.umd.edu).

Getting Started with PSL
------------------------

If you want to use PSL to build models, you probably do not need this source code.
Instead, visit the [Getting Started guide](../../wiki/Core-Topics) to learn
how to create PSL projects that will automatically install a stable version of these libraries.

Installing PSL from Source
--------------------------

If you do want to install PSL from source, you can use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.x.
In the top-level directory of the PSL source (which should be the same directory that holds this README), run
```
	mvn install
```
